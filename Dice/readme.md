# ðŸŽ² Dice Score (Dice Coefficient)

The Dice Score (Dice Coefficient) is a widely used metric in image segmentation to measure the overlap between predicted and ground truth masks. It evaluates how well a segmentation model's output aligns with the actual segmentation. A **higher Dice Score** (closer to 1) means better overlap, while a **lower score** (closer to 0) indicates poor segmentation.

The Dice Score is defined as:
                      **Dice= 2âˆ£Aâˆ©Bâˆ£/âˆ£Aâˆ£+âˆ£Bâˆ£**

Where:
* A is the predicted segmentation mask
* B is the ground truth mask
* âˆ£Aâˆ©Bâˆ£ is the number of overlapping pixels
* âˆ£Aâˆ£+âˆ£Bâˆ£ represents the total pixels in both masks

#### Red regions â†’ High overlap (where both prediction and ground truth agree).
#### Blue regions â†’ Low overlap (mismatch or incorrect segmentation).
#### Flat areas (near 0) â†’ No segmentation detected in either the prediction or the ground truth.
